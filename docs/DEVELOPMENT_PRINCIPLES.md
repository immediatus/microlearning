# Development Principles & Standards

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Documentation-First Development
- **Every decision must be documented** with rationale and alternatives considered
- **All code changes require documentation updates** in relevant files
- **No PR merges without updated documentation** (enforced by CI/CD)
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for all significant technical decisions

### 2. AI-Assisted Development with Human Oversight
- **All AI-generated code must be reviewed** by human developers
- **AI tools are assistants, not replacements** for human judgment
- **AI suggestions must be validated** against project requirements
- **Track and document AI service usage** for cost and quality control

### 3. Student-First Design Philosophy
- **Every feature prioritizes student experience** over creator convenience
- **Mobile-first responsive design** for all user interfaces
- **Performance targets must meet mobile standards** (< 3s load time)
- **Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)** for all features

### 4. Quality-First Development
- **Code coverage minimum: 80%** for all new features
- **No production deployments** without passing all quality gates
- **Automated testing at multiple levels** (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Security scanning** on every commit

### 5. Cost-Conscious AI Usage
- **Every AI operation requires cost tracking** and budget approval
- **Caching strategies must be implemented** to minimize redundant AI calls
- **Fallback options required** for all AI services
- **Regular cost optimization reviews** conducted weekly

## Documentation Standards

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

All significant technical decisions must be documented using ADRs in `/docs/decisions/`:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the issue or situation requiring a decision]

## Decision
[State the decision made]

## Rationale
[Explain why this decision was made]

## Consequences
[Describe the resulting context after applying the decision]

## Alternatives Considered
[List alternative options and why they were not chosen]

## Implementation Plan
[Outline steps to implement this decision]
```

### Code Documentation Standards

#### Python Code Documentation
```python
def generate_educational_content(
    concept: str, 
    age_group: str, 
    difficulty: int = 5
) -> ContentResult:
    """
    Generate educational content for a specific concept and age group.
    
    This function orchestrates the AI content generation pipeline including
    script writing, visual creation, and quality assurance checks.
    
    Args:
        concept: The educational concept to teach (e.g., "photosynthesis")
        age_group: Target age range (e.g., "12-15")
        difficulty: Difficulty level from 1-10 (default: 5)
    
    Returns:
        ContentResult containing generated script, visuals, and metadata
    
    Raises:
        AIServiceError: If AI generation fails
        BudgetExceededError: If operation exceeds budget limits
        
    Example:
        >>> result = await generate_educational_content(
        ...     concept="gravity",
        ...     age_group="12-15", 
        ...     difficulty=6
        ... )
        >>> print(result.script)
    
    Cost Impact:
        - Estimated cost: $0.50-$2.00 per generation
        - Uses: OpenAI GPT-4, DALL-E 3, ElevenLabs TTS
        
    Performance:
        - Average generation time: 45-90 seconds
        - Concurrent generations: Max 5 per creator
        
    See Also:
        - docs/AI_CONTENT_PIPELINE.md for detailed workflow
        - ADR-0001 for AI service selection rationale

 */
```

### API Documentation Standards

All API endpoints must include:
