# ADR-0002: Mobile-First Architecture Strategy

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-08-15

## Context

The MicroLearning platform targets 12-15 year old students who primarily consume content on mobile devices. We need to decide on the technical architecture that will deliver the best user experience for our primary audience while maintaining development efficiency.

Key considerations:
- 98% of target users access content via mobile devices
- Performance requirements for 3G/4G networks
- App store distribution vs. web-based delivery
- Development team capacity and expertise
- Cross-platform compatibility needs

## Decision

We will implement a **Progressive Web App (PWA) with React Native components** strategy:

### Primary Platform: React Native
- **Student Mobile App**: React Native with Expo for iOS and Android
- **Target**: Native app store distribution for optimal performance
- **Video Player**: Custom implementation optimized for 9:16 content
- **Offline Support**: Local caching for videos and progress data

### Secondary Platform: React Web App
- **Creator Dashboard**: React web application for content creators
- **Admin Interface**: Web-based administration and analytics
- **Landing/Marketing**: Static site with educational content preview

### Shared Infrastructure
- **API-First Design**: FastAPI backend serving both platforms
- **Component Library**: Shared design system between React and React Native
- **Content Delivery**: CDN-optimized for mobile video streaming

## Rationale

### React Native for Mobile App
**Pros:**
- Native performance for video playback and animations
- Access to device APIs (camera, push notifications, offline storage)
- App store distribution for better discoverability
- Shared codebase between iOS and Android (95%+ code reuse)
- Large ecosystem of educational app libraries

**Cons:**
- Additional complexity compared to web-only solution
- App store approval process and updates
- Platform-specific testing requirements

**Alternatives Considered:**

**Native iOS/Android Development:**
- Rejected due to development team capacity
- Would require separate teams for each platform
- Longer development time and higher maintenance cost

**Flutter:**
- Rejected due to team's existing React expertise
- Smaller ecosystem for educational content features
- Less mature video handling capabilities

**Web-Only Solution:**
- Rejected due to performance limitations on mobile
- Limited offline capabilities
- Inferior user experience for video content
- No access to native device features

### React Web App for Creator Dashboard
**Pros:**
- Faster development with team's existing expertise
- Better desktop experience for content creation workflow
- Easier integration with AI services and admin features
- No app store restrictions for frequent updates

**Cons:**
- Creators may prefer mobile-first creation tools
- Limited offline capabilities for content creation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Optimal performance for primary user base (students)
- Native mobile experience with smooth video playback
- Efficient development with shared React expertise
- App store presence for better user acquisition
- Offline learning capabilities for poor network areas

### Negative
- Increased complexity in maintaining two platforms
- App store submission and approval process overhead
- Platform-specific testing and debugging requirements
- Additional build and deployment pipelines needed

### Technical Implications
- Need for comprehensive testing across multiple devices
- Platform-specific video optimization strategies
- Careful state management between online/offline modes
- Push notification infrastructure for engagement
