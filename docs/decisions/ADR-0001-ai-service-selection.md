# ADR-0001: AI Service Selection Strategy

## Status
**Accepted** - 2025-08-15

## Context

The MicroLearning platform heavily relies on AI services for content generation. We need to select primary and fallback AI services for:
- Text generation (educational scripts, quiz questions)
- Image generation (visual aids, diagrams)
- Voice synthesis (narration)
- Video generation (animations, demonstrations)
- Music generation (background audio)

Key considerations:
- Quality of educational content output
- Cost per operation at scale (100k+ users)
- Reliability and service availability
- API integration complexity
- Content safety and appropriateness for children

## Decision

We will implement a **multi-provider strategy with automatic fallbacks**:

### Primary Services (Premium Tier)
- **Text Generation**: OpenAI GPT-4 → Anthropic Claude fallback
- **Image Generation**: DALL-E 3 → Midjourney fallback
- **Voice Synthesis**: ElevenLabs → Azure Speech fallback
- **Video Generation**: RunwayML → Pika Labs fallback
- **Music Generation**: Suno AI → AIVA fallback

### Service Tier Architecture
- **Premium**: Highest quality, higher cost (for featured content)
- **Standard**: Good quality, moderate cost (for regular content)
- **Budget**: Acceptable quality, lowest cost (for high-volume generation)

## Rationale

### OpenAI GPT-4 for Text Generation
**Pros:**
- Excellent educational content quality
- Strong safety filters for child-appropriate content
- Reliable API with good uptime
- Extensive documentation and community support

**Cons:**
- Higher cost per token ($0.03/$0.06 input/output)
- Rate limits may affect scale

**Alternative Considered:** Anthropic Claude
- Selected as fallback due to comparable quality
- Lower cost structure beneficial for scale

### DALL-E 3 for Image Generation
**Pros:**
- High-quality educational illustrations
- Good understanding of educational concepts
- Built-in safety filters
- 9:16 aspect ratio support for mobile

**Cons:**
- $0.040 per image (standard quality)
- Limited customization options

### ElevenLabs for Voice Synthesis
**Pros:**
- Natural-sounding voices appropriate for education
- Multiple voice options for different age groups
- Good emotional expression capabilities
- Reasonable pricing at $0.18/1000 characters

**Cons:**
- Smaller company with potential reliability concerns
- Limited voice customization

## Consequences

### Positive
- High-quality educational content generation
- Automatic failover ensures service reliability
- Cost optimization through tier-based selection
- Consistent content quality across all media types

### Negative
- Complex integration with multiple providers
- Higher initial development cost
- Need for comprehensive cost tracking and budgeting
- Potential consistency issues between different services

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement comprehensive caching to reduce API calls
- Budget controls and approval workflows for cost management
- Health monitoring for all services with automatic failover
- Content quality scoring to ensure consistency

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Implement AI service manager with fallback logic
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 and DALL-E 3
- [ ] Add ElevenLabs voice synthesis
- [ ] Implement cost tracking system

### Phase 2: Fallback Services (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Integrate Anthropic Claude as text fallback
- [ ] Add Midjourney integration for image fallback
- [ ] Implement Azure Speech as voice fallback
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Implement service health monitoring
- [ ] Add automatic tier selection based on budget
- [ ] Implement content caching strategies
- [ ] Add quality scoring and feedback loops

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Performance optimization and load testing
- [ ] Cost optimization and budget tuning
- [ ] Quality assurance automation
- [ ] Documentation and training materials

## Success Metrics

- **Content Quality**: >90% approval rate from educators
- **Service Availability**: >99.5% uptime for content generation
- **Cost Efficiency**: <$2.00 average cost per complete learning video
- **Generation Speed**: <60 seconds for complete content generation
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating for generated content quality

## Review Schedule

This decision will be reviewed quarterly based on:
- Service performance metrics
- Cost analysis and budget impact
- Content quality feedback
- New service availability and capabilities
- User growth and scaling requirements
