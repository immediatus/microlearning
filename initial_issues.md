# Initial Issues for Jules Agent

Here are the first few GitHub issues to create for Jules agent development:

## Issue 1: Complete Database Models and Migrations

**Title:** [JULES] Complete database models and Alembic migrations setup

**Labels:** `jules`, `backend`, `database`

**Description:**
Implement missing database models and set up Alembic migrations for the MicroLearning platform.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete missing models: Quiz, Creator, Analytics, Approval tables
- [ ] Set up Alembic configuration and initial migrations
- [ ] Add proper foreign key relationships between all models
- [ ] Include database indexes for performance optimization
- [ ] Write comprehensive model tests with fixtures

**Technical Context:**
- Extend existing models in `app/models/`
- Follow patterns established in `student.py` and `content.py`
- Reference cost tracking models in `app/services/cost_tracker.py`
- Ensure async SQLAlchemy compatibility

**Files to modify:**
- `app/models/quiz.py` (create)
- `app/models/creator.py` (create)
- `app/models/analytics.py` (create)
- `alembic/` (setup migrations)
- `tests/test_models.py` (create)
