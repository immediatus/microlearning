# MicroLearning Platform

## Project Overview

An AI-powered microlearning platform focused on STEM education for students aged 12-15, featuring short-form video content (45-90 seconds) with interactive knowledge validation.

### Core Concept
- **TikTok-style educational videos** optimized for smartphone consumption
- **Interactive quiz validation** between video segments
- **AI-generated content** with minimal human oversight
- **Spaced repetition learning** for improved retention

### Key Statistics
- Target users: 100,000+ students
- Creator to user ratio: 1:100,000
- Video duration: 45-90 seconds (optimal attention span)
- Quiz timing: 3-5 seconds per question
- Knowledge retention improvement: 18% over traditional methods

## Architecture Overview

### Student-First Design
- **Priority 1**: Ultra-modern mobile UI for students
- **Priority 2**: Minimal AI-powered creator interface
- **Mobile-first**: 9:16 vertical video format (TikTok/Instagram Reels style)
